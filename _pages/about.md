I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of ECE at the University of Virginia, where I joined in Fall 2024. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Farzad Farnoud](https://fhfarnoud.github.io/index.html) in the [Information Processing and Storage Lab](https://ipsl.github.io/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Data Compression, Information Theory, and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in understanding the fundamental limits of data representation and exploring learning-based approaches to efficient communication and storage.

Prior to UVA, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Communication Engineering from Sichuan University, China.
